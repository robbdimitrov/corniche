# Router

Simple [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) router
without external dependencies.

## Motivation

There are too many routing libraries with countless dependencies.
This `router` project is an example of how to do the routing with pure React
using [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
and [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

## Features

- Display correct page based on path
- Allow access to path params and quary params
- Allow routing from within the app
- Set the `active` class on [Link](./src/router/Link.js) components
- Add a fallback case for wildcard/404 page
- Allow redirects
